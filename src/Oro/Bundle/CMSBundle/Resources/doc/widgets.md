Widgets enable you to render any html text generated by your custom PHP code, such as a marketing banner or a contact form.

## How to Support Widgets in Custom Content

To support widgets in any text, you should apply the `render_content` filter in a twig template.
 
 For example:
 
  ````twig
  {{ entity.content | oro_html_sanitize | render_content }}
  ````
