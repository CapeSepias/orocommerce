Feature: Price lists must be sortable in system configuration
  ToDo: BAP-16103 Add missing descriptions to the Behat features

  Scenario: Changing Price List Priorities
    Given I login as administrator
    And I go to System/Configuration
    And I click "Commerce"
    And I click "Catalog"
    And I click "Pricing"
    Then I should not see "Priority" in "Price List" table
    And I should see drag-n-drop icon present in "Price List" table
    When I click "Add Price List"
    And I choose Price List "first price list" in 2 row
    And I drag 2 row to the top in "Price List" table
    And I click "Save settings"
    Then I should see "Configuration saved" flash message
    And I should see that "first price list" is in 1 row
