UPGRADE FROM 1.2 to 1.3
=======================

**IMPORTANT**
-------------

The class `Oro\Bundle\SecurityBundle\SecurityFacade`, services `oro_security.security_facade` and `oro_security.security_facade.link`, and TWIG function `resource_granted` were marked as deprecated.
Use services `security.authorization_checker`, `security.token_storage`, `oro_security.token_accessor`, `oro_security.class_authorization_checker`, `oro_security.request_authorization_checker` and TWIG function `is_granted` instead.
In controllers use `isGranted` method from `Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller`.
The usage of deprecated service `security.context` (interface `Symfony\Component\Security\Core\SecurityContextInterface`) was removed as well.
All existing classes were updated to use new services instead of the `SecurityFacade` and `SecurityContext`:

- service `security.authorization_checker`
    - implements `Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Authorization\AuthorizationCheckerInterface`
    - the property name in classes that use this service is `authorizationChecker`
- service `security.token_storage`
